You will be able to ride out any bear market (including the Great Depression) if you think 30 years out. Most bear markets recover within 3 years. Follow a buy and hold diversified strategy that invests in stocks, bonds (and possibly real estate.) Dollar cost averaging will serve most investors well since it removes the costly behavioral errors all novice investors make. Disclaimer: This applies mainly to younger investors under 40 years old.\n\nIf you had put all of your money in the DJIA at the top of any bull market (even just before the Great Depression), you would have done okay if you held for 30 years.

I've already worked as a Google SWE intern in Mountain View and it was awesome. Would've preferred a city, but it's fine. I'm tempted to just go back again this summer so I can try a new city and have an easier full-time conversion process (2 less interviews I think? Or just 2 interviews). But then again, I want to check out Microsoft to see if I like it, and they don't have interviews for full-time conversion. (This will be my post-junior-year internship.)\n\nI don't really care about compensation as much--both offer amazing benefits and perks. Google is the \"cool\" company, but Microsoft seems to be doing a lot of cool things lately, especially with the Surface. I was a little taken aback by the feel of Microsoft's campus though. Google's offices are really open and everything feels fun and collegey. Microsoft has closed offices and looks more corporate. Just a bunch of buildings with little character. I know this shouldn't really matter when I'm deciding on a good *job*, but I can't help it. It makes it feel more like...an office? Like work? Corporate? Less fun? Google feels more social. Also, I like Seattle, but I don't think I could live there long term. Still, the work they're doing seems interesting and it's different.\n \nHas anyone here interned for both companies or knows people who have? What have you heard? What are your experiences with these companies?\n\nAnd no, I don't go to a target school, so there's not a lot of people I could ask about this.\n\n**Edit:** For both companies, I would have to accept before I'm matched to a team.\n\n**Edit2:** Any Microsoft interns want to share their experiences?\n\n**Edit3:** Thanks for the input guys!

Both are amazing at the end of the day and there is nothing I can say that will help you unfortunately. Luckily, the decision you're making is one most people would kill for, so there really is no wrong answer here. I will say that Microsoft is definitely social. Don't get caught up on that. You'll be hanging out with a bunch of interns, MS is always great about pointing out really cool events to you, and they do throw a bunch of awesome events. Redmond is also pretty great. I actually preferred it to MTV. Also, the MS office can be a lot of fun. They have sports stuff around campus, the buildings are internally pretty cool, they have this little area which is really fun to be in around lunch. The culture is definitely very different from Google but I wouldn't say that it's a corporate hell-hole. I liked it in some ways because, at Google it was easy to spend my whole day there hanging around on campus, whilst at MS I kind of had to get off campus and really explore and see things. Having your own office is definitely different, and it's a little strange not having access to your host/mentor right next to you but the tools for communication are great.\n\n\n\nI remember when I was close to interning at both and I was so scared I was going to make the wrong option and kept Googling/Binging to see if I was making the right choice, and I would read a horror story from one company... and then a horror story from the other. It really comes down to your team and your mentor, and the intern team at both companies is just the best. If you ever have issues you can just email them.\n\n\n\nThe third option, and I don't know how feasible it is but it's the one I chose and would choose again, just take a semester off and do both. Both of them are going to give you a unique experience college can't give and if it just means you're extending your studies by a semester, that isn't so bad.\n\n\n\nFeel free to PM if you have any more questions, but honestly, there is no wrong answer here.

I took a return offer.\n\nSomething to note is I did my internship during the off-season (december-march), on-season interns have a much more awesome time - but I had an awesome time too.\n\nAs a lot of other people have indicated, since you've already been to google, you should definitely check MS out! They treat interns really awesome, and every intern season has a 'signature event' - most recently it was maroon 5, surface 3s and a giant party at gasworks park in seattle. The recruiters run frequent intern-only events, like food tours, outing nights etc. every few weeks like clockwork. Board game nights with other interns etc.\n\nThey put you up (they make you chip a little in off your paycheck towards it but it's small - depends on if you choose 1BR/Studio/2BRshare) - food isn't free but there are cafeterias every few buildings so where you work there will be 'the cafeteria' you go to - although you're free to go to any you like. The cafeteria usually has a great variety of options (the one I was near had something like 10+ mini-stores within it with different cuisines) - it is subsidised so a burger and chips costs like $5 or something. soda is free. \n\nMicrosoft definitely doesn't have as much cool stuff like sleeping pods or bowling alleys but everyone seems to be pretty happy where I was, nobody is overworked, nobody stays extremely late and the cultural feel was one of the main reasons I chose to return full time. It seemed like a great place to have a good career and a great life balance too. My team had an open plan office similar to what you'd see a google so I never go to try office-based but I met heaps of cool people sitting near me because it was open plan.\n\nI would say the work varies ALOT depending on where you are placed, I got lucky and had an awesome experience - some other interns not so much. So I think at Microsoft it can be a lot more hit and miss depending on team placement - but I think it's worth the chance to get placed on an awesome team! Most people had a great experience I spoke to, only a few got unlucky or were just not a good fit themselves - hard to tell as I only heard their side of the story.\n\nAt the end of the day - the whole point of an internship is to get a taste of the company, get really well compensated for it, get some free hardware on the way and have plenty of fun - I say go to microsoft!", "sentiment_status": "UPDATED", "audio_status": "UPDATED", "sentiment": "POSITIVE", "audio": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/sentiview-audio/cvsi9bd.mp3", "neutral": "0.045", "mixed": "0.071", "negative": "0.015", "positive": "0.868"}, {"content": "I've interned at both - similar to you, I had a return offer from Google at the same as a Microsoft offer.\n\nYou said you didn't really care, but other readers might:\n\n - Microsoft intern perks are nice, last year was free Xbox, and if you're OSG (Operating Systems Group) a bunch of free games for it, plus all of the events. \n - Microsoft gave the majority of the interns offers in their last week - and they have fairly aggresive recruiters in comparison to google - so be prepared! Return offer determined by your manager ticking a yes/no box, basically.\n- On the other hand, they're (MS) much more willing to negotiate on stock and signing bonus than Google is. Google will ONLY negotiate if you have a higher offer to match.\n - They'll guarantee you a specific group (Applications vs OSG vs Cloud or something?) but not more specific than that.\n\nMicrosoft vs Google:\n\n - I strongly prefer linux as a dev environment. Visual Studio's nice, though.\n - My team at both was great. Newest person on the team had been there near 10 years.\n - Documentation at Microsoft... at least for my team... was badly lacking. Figuring out how a specific thing worked was 'go down one floor, and three offices over, and talk to the guy who wrote it'. Google's stuff seemed much better documented.\n - Offices were... offices. Unlike Google I had my own office, with a door. So, depends if you like open plan, or peace and quiet. And you could do whatever with your office - couches, coffee machines, fridges, etc. were common.\n - I... felt like I had to do a lot more work, at Google. \n - It took most of the first week to even be able to access anything at MS. \n - Half of the team occasionally went for lunch, maybe once a week - due to paid food, the other half ate on their own or something. And nobody really ever joins you at the table for lunch if you sit down, unlike Google. I missed the social aspect of this. And the cafeteria food's decent, but not as good, or as much variety - the cost's pretty insignificant.\n - Internal search/code indexing tools were much, much better at Google. \n - Seemed like MS was more generous with hardware budget than Google (from observing the full-timers.)\n - Culture: Microsoft has more ... corporate roadblocks. Noticeably so - my team was pretty open about disliking how this affected them.\n\nAll of the above said, I'm really glad I interned at both companies, and I'd do it again given the same choice. What I got out of it was a lot of figuring out what I did and didn't like in a job - and if I could mix and match aspects of both companies, I would. It was also good to try working in a very different area.\n\nI'd strongly recommend interning somewhere, anywhere that isn't Google to anyone before going back as a grad - it's much easier to try other things now than it is later. \n\n(I've... 5? friends who also interned at both, and so far it's 1:1 for Google:Microsoft grad jobs - the others either haven't graduated or went elsewhere. Everyone who tried got an offer for their preference.)\n\nI ended up fitting the second Google internship around classes (barely) later in the year and doing both - so that's also an option.
